The gender spectrum is traditionally a very narrow one. For the vast majority of society, the binary is simply boy and girl, but since the beginning of time, there have been those who have challenged that idea by stepping outside of the spectrum and living in a place wholly their own.

Introducing Gender Inbetween, a new show dedicated to the documentation of personal stories, histories, and anecdotes of individuals across the wide range of the genderqueer spectrum.

Episodes 1-10 launch on June 1st. [Subscribe](http://machine.fm/genderinbetween), listen, and learn.
