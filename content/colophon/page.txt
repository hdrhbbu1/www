Depending on who you are, this will either be the most appealing or loathesome page on my web site.

## Typography

Every line of text you read is set in (link: http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/canadatype/gibson text: Gibson), a wonderfully smooth sans-serif font designed by Rod McDonald and distributed by Canada Type.

## Content Management

Content management can be a royal pain, but since this is my personal site, I refused to accept any frustration. I chose (link: http://getkirby.com text: Kirby), a small, but powerful static site generator. It's simplicity is refreshing, and allows me to author content in Markdown.

## Hosting and Technical Administration

(link: http://name.com text: Name.com), my domain registrar, kicks serious ass. Don't even consider purchasing your domain anywhere else. (link: http://pagodabox.com text: Pagoda Box) provides hosting go-juice, so that even in busy times, the site remains online. If you enjoy this site, thank these people too.

## Design

All markup is HTML5, and anything beautiful is created with SASS.
