This week, we talk to NYC rocker [Aaron Zimmer](http://aaronzimmer.com). Aaron has a rich past, full of experiences that shaped him into who he is today. Listen, and you might learn a few things to help your career.

His story begins with high-school bar gigs, and a band that would eventually fail. Eventually, Aaron would find himself enroute to The Big Apple, his mind set on a successful solo career.

Several years later, he performs across the USA, has ran several successful crowdfunding campaigns, and released three albums digitally, on CD, and vinyl.

In this special interview, we explore his entire career, from the frustrating beginning though today, and peek at the year ahead. Aaron's music is available on [iTunes](https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/live-wires/id302797880) and in his [official store](http://aaronzimmer.com/Shop), so if you like what you hear, support his work!

We had a great time chatting for a little over an hour. Get ready, because Inside the Machine starts now.
