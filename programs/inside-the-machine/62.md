What began as a side project has, over the last year, slowly morphed into one of Chicago's finest and most innovative rock acts. Ashly Dalene, known well to many in our diverse music community, is the powerful woman behind it. Meet [Heroine Complex](http://facebook.com/HeroineComplex). Inspired by many successful rock operas before it, their debut album, [*Hollow*](http://heroinecomplex.bandcamp.com) explores the darker side of love.

After the disbandment of her former group, [One Wing Low](http://onewinglow.bandcamp.com), Dalene set out to create three short EPs, each of which run in the shadowy parts of operatic, female-fronted rock. With guitars ablaze, Dalene and her crew crafted a masterpiece so twisted and complex that &mdash; to understand it &mdash; you must listen for yourself.

On this week's edition of Inside the Machine, we go deep into her past work, plans for Heroine Complex, and future projects.
