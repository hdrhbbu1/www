Known for their bold-faced rock 'n' roll attitude and explosive sound, Kansas natives [The Noise FM](http://thenoisefm.net) already made an irreversible mark on the Windy City. Transplanted into their new home just several years ago, they quickly garnered a fan base interested in their straightforward but dancable melodies.

Their new record, Attraction, dropped a few weeks ago, and after many missed attempts, The Boys of Noise, Austin and Alex Ward, finally arrived in The Machine studio. We talk for a solid hour, exploring the ups and downs of their career, including the constantly disappearing bassist, which anchored the brothers in the group's core. Add in their newest member, Barry Kidd, and this three-piece is set to ignite the Midwest.
