Let's begin with a list of guitar greats: Eric Johnson, Phil Keaggy, Dann Huff, and [Rex Paul](http://rexpaulmusic.com). Rex's name might be unknown to most, but he certainly belongs on the list, ranking alongside any six-string virtuoso of our age.

A master producer and mix engineer too, Rex was raised on the music of Christopher Cross and Eric Johnson in the Texas hill country, just outside Austin. His local gigs soon led to a career in Music City U.S.A., where he expanded his talents at Sony Music, working as a studio performer. In 2013, you can hear his work on records by Brooks and Dunn, Brad Paisley, Bill Anderson, and many other acts from Nashville and beyond.

On a personal note, Rex has championed The Machine since it's inception. I'm excited to have him join me for _Inside the Machine_. Press play to hear the personal story behind his music.
