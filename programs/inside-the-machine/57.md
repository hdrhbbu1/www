Nashville's underground music scene is exploding, pushing several acts at it's forefront into the international spotlight. One of those talented artists is our new friend [Liza Anne](http://lizaannemusic.com). Once you hear her work, you'll fall in love (as we have) with her fearless lyrics and incomparable harmonies.

Like many others, her career began by moving to Music City where she attended Belmont University to study songwriting. Two years later, Liza dropped out to pursue her career as a musician full time.

Now, on the one-year anniversary of her debut release, *The Colder Months*, she joins Nicholas Young in-studio to recount the journey so far.
