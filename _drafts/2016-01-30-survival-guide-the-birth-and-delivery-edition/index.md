If the information age has taught us anything, it's that "wisdom of crowds" is fickle, and most times, unnecessary. I'm serious. We needed Lyft to tell us most strangers were okay. Twitter to help us keep in touch. Facebook to build our virtual family, and keep in touch with the real one.

These are all truths, bore out in my life and the lives of friends &mdash; but they also are, at the core, affirmations of what we already knew.

Nobody needed to tell me most strangers were fine, at least for adults. All social media contact once happened at the local general store and town square. Our family, in the past, was never so geographically distant.

These are restatements: stories that confirm our basic ideologies.

With the re-launch of my blog, and eager, virtual pen, I quickly realized that a majority of you were hungry for information: [about our daughter](/girl-meets-world), the [heartfelt experience of a first-time father](/dad-jokes), and of course, [JavaScript](/state-js-2016-javascript-here-and-now). I know my audience well, and you will also appreciate this post, penned while my wife and daughter are asleep, featuring the latest hard-won advice from the past week.

It is in that spirit that I present Young's *Survival Guide: the Birth and Delivery Edition*, a profile of what you should, and should not do when expecting. Specifically, how to make the most of your hospital stay, from the perspective of a recent guest.

## #1. Train Hard

While this phrase often forecasts pain, difficulty, and hopefully, victory; today, I'm removing the former portions.

Sleep. No, *really sleep*. In your own bed, the most comfortable one you own. It prepares you for the road ahead: which is, and I speak from experience, riddled with terrible bedding hardware. I'll try to mitigate that next, but you may not succeed. I went, without sleep, for 48 hours solid. Prepare for battle.

## #2. Take Your Air Mattress

...and if you don't currently own one, run to the store now. They're inexpensive and better than the [concrete bedding experience](/dad-jokes) that you'll encounter by default.

Call the hospital now, and ask if you may bring an air bed for Dad. Hospital staff will ask you to sleep on the provided mattresses set aside for guests, but if you're like me, persist. In my experience, crews are trained with laser-focus on their trade (which is a good thing), and few have experienced the pain themselves. This is a must, especially if you have joint pain or other chronic issues.

You must be coherent enough to care for mother and child. If at all possible, buy and use an air mattress. A cot is fine if you cannot, and even better if provided by hospital staff. You want air or a spring underneath you: not cheap foam.

## 3. Choose a Reputable Hospital System

We are exceptionally grateful to call Chicago home, mostly because [Prentice Women's Hospital](https://www.nm.org/location/prentice-womens-hospital), [one of the top birth and delivery systems in the country,](http://www.wbnorthwestern.org/history-mission) is only a short drive away.

The Doctors on-staff (and on-call) we're, in a word, exceptional. They complimented our sleep-deprived selves in a transparent fashion that I've rarely seen in other health systems. I kid you not, call a Doc or Nurse and see if you expect it to feel like war. None of that happened at Prentice, despite the above complaint. (Most of the blame can be laid at my feet, for [staying up 48 hours](http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/can-a-lack-of-sleep-cause) until I was psychotic.)

## 4. Harden Yourself

You will see blood. I know, it's gross, and we rarely discuss the red gold that flows within our veins and keeps all of us alive. But I must (and should do it within polite context). Here goes.

If you, specifically as a Dad, want to be in the room for every crucial moment &mdash; at least attempt to harden yourself. The common assumption inside the Doctors' head is that you will faint once blood appears. I was annoyed by this pre-emptive strike on my perspective and rights as a Dad. Dammit, this is *my daughter too* and I will be here for her every waking moment.

You will be too. But this world also houses many individuals, fathers and mothers too, who would hurt this little one or her mother, given half a chance.

Find the balance; and believe me, it can be struck. At times, you must advocate for yourself and the family you love. Others will find you uncomfortably bending to flawed rules designed by others, perhaps in anger, but often with good intentions.
