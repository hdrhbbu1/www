Entrepreneurs are often fired up, and for good reason - they’re working on something they’re passionate about. However, it sometimes takes months, or even years for their vision to be realized. In that time, these creative machines are either stuck in a dead end job, or taking various freelance projects to pay the bills while pursuing their dream. Put yourself in that scenario, and it’s tough to avoid burnout. Over the last year, I’ve worked many different projects, and gleaned some wisdom that I hope will be valuable to you.

1. When you connect with someone new, whether they’re a client or not, think about how their mission (and if they’re a client, your work for them) relates to what you ultimately want to do.
You never know if that guy or girl across the table is someone very influential, or what your clients do in their spare time. Think about it, and you’ll be better equipped to move forward when you need references or beta-testers for your product or service.

2. Live.
You’re a creative, and so attending brainstorming sessions can keep your creative juices flowing. I’m especially guilty here. Don’t do what I’ve done, and go into marathon weekend development sessions when you could be out with other people just like you. Balance is crucial.

3. Build a solid set of rules, and stick to ‘em.
Being a freelancer means you don’t have the corporate overhead that protects most developers. You’re exposed to the elements of client pressure, hard deadlines, and fault. That’s right, even when the customer breaks your code by inputting an endless string of asterisks, it’s your fault. Setting up solid rules, and sticking to them will make your job easier. Pleasing the customer is important, but keep in mind - you can’t please everyone.

**4. Be Flexible.**

While undercutting yourself isn’t a great idea (it can kill your self-esteem and willingness to work), sometimes you have to. (Surprisingly, this comes right after setting boundaries, right?) See, there’s a fine art - knowing when to stick your neck out and be helpful, and when to not. Sometimes you’ll bend over backwards, and get bit in the ass, and other times, it’ll pay off. (I’m still working on learning this one. I’m far too nice.) 

**5. Study hard. It’s worth it.**

Know the limitations of both you, and the tools you’re working with. I can’t stress this enough. It’s always better to under promise and over deliver - those invisible brick walls (called expectations) will get you every time.

There, the top 5 ways to freelance, while maintaining your sanity, strength, and vision. I’d love to hear your comments and suggestions. How to you do it?
