They've been active since 1993, so this band knows how the music business works. They recently became independent and released their first remix EP, *Inlandia*. Today, I'm very excited to speak with Charlie Lowell of [Jars of Clay](http://www.jarsofclay.com), about the process behind *Inland*, Jars' eleventh studio album, and the subsequent remix album.

Together, Charlie and I walk through the band's history. Jars' began as a popular college act and quickly grew in popularity &mdash; evolving into a national sensation virtually overnight. 20 years in, they aren't ready to stop. This is only the beginning.

*Inland* is, to me, Jars deepest record in recent history. The lyrics step away from the band's expected contemporary Christian heritage, opting to tell metaphorical stories rather than directly communicate religious ideals. It's also the band's first project, released on their label Gray Matters.

In this hour, Charlie weaves a unique, behind-the-scenes narrative, disclosing the story behind the band. It's nothing short of what you've come to expect from Inside the Machine.
