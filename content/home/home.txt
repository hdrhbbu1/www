Photography:
	title: Photographer
	description: I work in multiple artistic mediums, but photography was my first love. Why? Because it *stops time*. It freezes it cold, preserving emotion that was likely only present once. Capturing the right moment is a tricky proposition, but over the last decade, I've perfected my technique.

Film:
	title: Director
	description: Motion pictures expand the concept of photography to include motion, a powerful, emotional tool. Film is a powerful tool in any creators arsenal, and must be wielded with care. The shaky home-movie age passed long ago. Let's continue to push filmcraft forward.

Production:
	title: Mastering Engineer
	description: Music is the heart of everything I do. It fuels my creative process, and inspires me to create better work, and dream larger. As a producer and mastering engineer, I've had opportunies to work with some of the brightest independent artists to create well-crafted records that endure the test of time.
