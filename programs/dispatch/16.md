  While we often explore other forms of art, this week, it's all about music.
  Joel Ebner of the Chicago band City States joins us for a talk about
  musicianship, production, and balancing creativity with promotion.

It's 2013, and musicians carry more weight today than ever before. Musicianship, production, and distribution are often the concern of an individual (or a small cadre of bandmates), rather than a corporation. For some, this represents power to choose, while others see it as unnecessary cruft that slows their creative process.

Our guest this week is Joel Ebner of the Chicago-based band, [City States](http://citystatesmusic.com). He joins Joshua and Nicholas fresh from the band's first mixing session for their first full-length project.

He discusses the band's formation, how his digital workflow enhances creativity, and how to balance promotion with your other duties. If you're a musician, or work in the media industry, this episode is not to be missed.
