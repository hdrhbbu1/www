For [Emily Hearn](http://emilyhearn.com), what started as an experiment, is now her career. Growing up in rural Georgia, Emily busied herself by learning guitar (though without a teacher). It began with country and rock standards, but this passionate songwriter was soon crafting her own melodies by ear.

College exposed Emily to live music by way of Athens, Georgia, the legendary hotbed of musical experimentation. Friends encouraged her to test her own songs in the forgiving town, and soon, her audience began to grow.

Three records and countless tours later, this talented artist is on an unquestionably favorable path. Her signature blend of folk-flavored pop is bending the ears of audiences nationwide.
