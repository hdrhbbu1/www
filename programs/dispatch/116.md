This week, your hosts offer a look behind the scenes of our first event, Chick Habit Live! Recorded before a live audience at Quenchers Saloon here in Chicago, and organized by our own [Ashly Dalene](http://machine.fm/people/ashly-dalene), [Chick Habit](http://machine.fm/chickhabit) Live was designed to showcase some of the brightest women-driven bands in our city. Now, the following week after the event, we chat about what went right, wrong, and more.

It's also worth noting, here in the afterglow, that events like this are a serious responsibility. If you want to see us continue our work to empower members of our music scene and around the world, [do us a favor and donate](http://machine.fm/donate). Your contributions, large and small, help keep us on the air and spreading educational, positive programming to listeners across the globe.
