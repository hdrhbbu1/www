  Rock, pop, and electro all have their place - but XYZR_KX stands somewhere in
  between. In this hour, Nicholas talks to Jon Monteverde (the man behind the

  outside recognized genres.

Visit your favorite CD store, and look at the labeled genres. Rock and pop will surely be listed, but nowhere will you find tracks like those belonging to [XYZR_KX](http://xyzrkx.com).

Jon Monteverde, Chicago's electro-pop wunderguy, is the musician and songwriter behind the project. Pronounced "scissor kicks", Jon produces haunting melodies only equalled in originality by his name.

In this hour, we discuss how it feels when your music exists outside recognized genres, what "innovation" really means to an artist, and much more.
