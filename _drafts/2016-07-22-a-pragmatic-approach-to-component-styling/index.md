This fall will mark my twentieth year online. In that time, the face of the web has changed significantly; morphing from a simple document retrieval mechanism supporting HTML only into the world's most powerful application development platform.

If you think I'm exaggerating, consider that without the internet's most basic protocols (which most of us take for granted), your home phone would cease to function. Like everything else, it's likely connected not to a copper phone line, but instead the same coaxial or fiber optic cable that services your household with television and internet.

If you think history is boring, I understand. This retelling is only present to establish my personal timeline and link the Internet's evolution with my own.

In the open source community, I strive to be known as a pragmatist; someone who embraces change when the benefit is immediately obvious, but investigates new concepts before accepting them if the upside isn't immediately clear. This could be a full-time job &mdash; though my role should be to weigh responsibilities of the developer, business stakeholders, and users &mdash; and not that of a tech pundit.

For the last several months, one of my main projects has been a heavily networked, multi-platform React application. While I'll be writing more on [React](/tag/react)
