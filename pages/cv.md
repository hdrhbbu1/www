After fifteen years as a mostly independent software consultant and educator, I'm ready to focus primarily on my time in the classroom. Since my first experience teaching robotics (while still in high school), I have made education a priority in my career. However, as an adolescent intrigued by software, I lacked a qualified mentor. This experience informs my belief that students of today deserve to be taught by industry professionals.

Technology's growing influence on every industry is obvious, and I hope to partner with an organization that is working to prepare students for the future.

### Core Skills

JavaScript, Elixir, React, Redux, ESLint, Webpack, Golang, FFmpeg, Docker, Kubernetes, Neovim, and Alpine Linux are just a few of the tools I use frequently. However, I have also been known to occasionally hack in C, Java, Objective-C, Ruby, or PHP.

In the classroom, I have experience preparing and executing lesson plans that prepare students for technology careers, by providing a safe but challenging environment that effectively simulates real-world engineering challenges.
