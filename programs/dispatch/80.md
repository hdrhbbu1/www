Whether you work for yourself, small businesses, or corporations, you will eventually be invited to collaborate on a project with other creators. For most, it's a joy &mdash; the exhilirating process of seeing your own work, combined in myriad ways with pieces created by another &mdash; and together, form a complete whole. To others, collaboration is off limits: they're too scared of letting go and allowing foreign influences to creep in.

Surely there is a balance to be struck. Today on Dispatch, we discuss how to choose your companions and collaborators with care and discerning taste, as you hope to avoid uncomfortable situations, wasted money, and lost time.

It's a challenge, but one that we assure you, is worth the effort. Learn how to communicate, prioritize, and dream clearer, with the input of someone else.
