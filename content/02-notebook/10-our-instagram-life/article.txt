Tweet. Post. Comment. Like. This era has it's own lingo; a jargon-addled psuedolanguage that sometimes barely resembles recognized speech or written words. Children, teenagers, and adults alike all speak it, as everyone desperately tries to capture fleeting memories with short blocks of text, a blurry photograph, or unlistenable audio clip. Most attempts fail, falling short of the moment when they were written or snapped.

Whenever I board the train, I'm surrounded by passengers craning their neck downward to catch up on the latest news. As if made from stone, they sit still while the city whizzes past, only rising immediately before exiting at their appointed stop. At concerts, when the focus should be on the performer, everyone raises their phone into the air &mdash; sometimes recording the entire performance, knowing fullwell the resulting video will be a pixelated mess.

This behavior is universally recognized, repeating itself daily without fail, and seemingly controlled by a greater mind. We behave as the program instructs &mdash; peering through dark portholes into lives of our virtual friends, seeking approval in the form of _likes_, _retweets_, and droning commentary. It's dangerous.

We complain that the world moves too quickly, and about our lack of creative fulfillment &mdash; but the problem is us, not the world. As a society, we lied to ourselves, inventing shiny new ways to document our life, when in reality, they clutter our minds, and sometimes, prevent us from creating memories at all.

As your son throws his first ball, would you rather watch or fumble with your phone? When a performer walks on stage, is it better to bathe in the moment, or shoot overexposed images that you will soon trash? Is a train commute an opportunity to reset your mind, and focus on subconcious creative tasks, or thumb through and _like_ content because you're strangely compelled to? Board the train, and stare out the window as the city rushes past. Breathe. Listen. Be alive. If, for every waking moment, I tap busily at my phone, I risk missing the magic of _life itself_.

Are Instagram, Facebook, and Twitter inherently bad for us? Of course not. I've explored the all, and use the latter two daily, but I'm always careful to close the laptop, or kill my phone when necessary. I'm alive for a fixed period of time. The magic of breathing, hearing, seeing, and feeling won't last forever.

It's imperative, more now than ever, that we develop healthy digital habits. Otherwise, the next generation will simply adopt our bad habits, and advance their application, leading them to lead increasingly reclusive lives, though they're constantly surrounded by _friends_.

This is a call to purpose. If you feel a moment deserves preservation, record it with careful consideration. If you aren't living, breathing, and documenting your life with _purpose_, part of you is already dead.
