On episode 16 of Gender Inbetween, Emile H. explains how they grew up in a tightly defined social setting, but began to truly understand their sexuality and gender identity beginning in high school.

"I grew up in Stoke Ferry England, because my parents we in the military. I spent a lot of time by myself, and a lot of time watching TV. I found myself really identifying with androgynous characters in movies and stuff, because I didn't really have much social connection... I kinda would pretend that I was those characters a lot; I guess that was one of the first instances of 'gender weirdness' happened. Then, through high school [I] experienced asexuality, I experienced queerness."

"When I was in college, I really started to understand my sexuality, because I fell in love with a girl. That prompted me to think about and understand my gender and sexuality, because I kinda always assumed that I was straight, and cis &mdash; because that's kind of how I was raised... with the expectation that I was straight and cis. I was never given the vocabulary of the LGBT community, or anything like that. It was like these are very specific gender roles that you're allowed to exist in, and nothing else."
