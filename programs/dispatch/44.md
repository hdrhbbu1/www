  discussion covering why art matters, and how we, as creators, can give back to
  our communities.

Why do we create? For some, art is an act of personal fulfillment. To others, it's a catalyst for social change. But as creators, do we owe anything to our society? Does society owe us for our contributions to culture?

Today on Dispatch, Joshua and Nicholas are excited to host a panel centered around the questions above. Each of our multitalented panelists brings their own experiences to the table in this lively discussion.
