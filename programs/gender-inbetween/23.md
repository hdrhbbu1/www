"I grew up in Dearborn, Michigan, a suburb of Detroit. I was the only daughter of two Lebanese immigrants &mdash; their marriage was arranged, which an interesting, slightly different background. So yeah, I grew up in Dearborn, went to school in Kalamazoo, came to Chicago for grad school at the University of Chicago."

"My personal coming out story wasn't a super-great one &mdash; it's certainly changed &mdash; but the whole process of me kinda coming to terms with my sexuality was very... sort-of it was very up in the air, I wasn't sure what I was feeling. So I didn't think that initial attractions to women constituted any kind of identity, or even a real sexual orientation at first. At first, I thought these were just these fluid moments until it became very clear to toward the end of college and grad school that I'm very clearly a lesbian."
