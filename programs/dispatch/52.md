  For the past year, we've had many opportunities to share the stories of
  creatives, lessons from their businesses, and how they overcame frustrating
  (sometimes) debilitating needs in both their private and artistic lives. In
  this episode, we look back at our first year on the air, and offer a
  "listener's guide" to the last 51 hours of Dispatch.

For the past year, Dispatch has been a place where creatives can unwind, share, and learn. Our listeners (that's you!), hear fellow artists share the deepest frustrations, but also tips for success. Guests experience a breed of unfiltered honesty from the hosts, and freedom to share their story in a comfortable, low-pressure environment that we believe is unlike any other radio program.

We've discussed what it's like to run an independent record label, how to build custom bicycles (starting with only a few metal tubes), [why your business might benefit from a physical location](http://machine.fm/dispatch/8), [whether you should specialize on one area of art](http://machine.fm/dispatch/1) (or remain a generalist), and many other intriguing topics. We recorded in the studio with guests, live at Transistor, then came to you from [Show of Hands](http://machine.fm/dispatch/22), the year's best [handmade design show](http://machine.fm/dispatch/23), and the [Ravenswood Community Council](http://ravenswoodchicago.org)'s *Greener Ravenswood* event. No other show (at least that we've heard) has covered the breadth of topics that you'll hear in our archive.

Of course, we couldn't have done this without the support of our friends. If you've contributed to the show in any way, we're thankful. It also wouldn't be an honest celebration if we didn't thank our listeners: you're the reason we stay on the air. Thanks for tuning in each week.

On today's episode, you'll hear the best excerpts from our friends [Tandem Shop Records](http://machine.fm/dispatch/6), [Bobby Horton](http://machine.fm/dispatch/24), [Legacy Frameworks](http://machine.fm/dispatch/25), [Derrick Clifton](http://machine.fm/dispatch/9), and [The Neutral Sound](http://machine.fm/dispatch/37). If any of these clips pique your interest, dig back into our archive to hear the full episodes! To date, we've released over 51 hours of wonderful, informative conversations, so there's plenty to keep your ears occupied for a while.
