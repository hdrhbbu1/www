As a kid, you probably heard the old saying "you are what you eat." With little modification, this phrase rings true especially for artists: "you create like you eat." Fast food, freezer dinners, and takeout can be staples of the creative life, but it doesn't have to be that way.

In this hour, former ballet dancer and now Head Chef of the [Chestnut Street Inn](http://chestnut-inn.com) Monika Sudakov joins your hosts to discuss how artists, home-based workers, and anyone else with a little time to spare can eat healthy.

Whether you're focused on a project, up against client deadlines, or working on a personal art piece, never forget to eat healthy. Your output will be better for it.
