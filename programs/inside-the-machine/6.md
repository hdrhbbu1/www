I think of Kevin Reeves, and a few phrases instantly come to mind. He's a trailblazer, master keyboardist, and an excellent producer. For me, he's also a friend.

We both lived in Nashville for several years, and both struggled to make our impact. We both love the city dearly, but both left in the end. 

Today, I bring you an intimate portrait of a musician on his way to stardom, but realizes that level of recognition requires time, and a lot of hard work. His new album, *Remember To Forget*, is expected to drop later this year.
