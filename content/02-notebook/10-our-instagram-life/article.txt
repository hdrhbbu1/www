Tweet. Post. Comment. Smile. This era has it's own lingo: a jargon-addled psuedolanguage that sometimes barely resembles recognized speech or written words. Children, teenagers, and adults alike all speak it; as everyone desperately tries to capture fleeting memories with a tweet, photo, or audio clip. Most attempts fail, falling short in describing the glorious moment when they were written, snapped, or recorded.

In a world where everyone is searching for creative fulfillment and avenues for personal expression, as a society, we've lied to ourselves. We said anyone with something to say should say it, but those with something to say are simply loudmouths with no substance. We're spinning ourselves crazy, trying to capture every moment, and find ourselves living through a 3x5 glass panel.
