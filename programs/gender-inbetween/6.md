Justin Bowen discusses growing up and discovering their genderqueer identity within the weirdness of Oil City, PA before moving onto Pittsburgh and assimilating into the city's dense tapestry of DIY and safe punk spaces.

"I'm married to a female, who is pan sexual, and she's super supportive of me being queer. We've been together for ten years and we just got married."

"It's inspirational to be like, 'I'm queer, even though it looks like I'm not.' I feel like a lot of times, my queerness isn't validated with certain people because of that. But really, it all comes down to how I feel inside."
