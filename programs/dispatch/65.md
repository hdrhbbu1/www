In today's world, most people only subsist. They live daily without control over their life, career, or finances. And yet, they're afraid of the tool that could revolutionize their existence. I'm talking, once again, about business. If you're living off the crumbs of someone else's passion, slogging though the 9-5, have a tolerance for risk and are driven to succeed &mdash; this episode is for you.

Our guest is powerhouse founder [Marcus Whitney](http://marcuswhitney.com). As one of the driving forces behind Nashville's thriving business community, he knows a thing or two about building successful companies.

This isn't Silicon Valley bullshit. (We all know the pitch of a snake-oil salesman: extreme growth, and a massive payout isn't required.)
