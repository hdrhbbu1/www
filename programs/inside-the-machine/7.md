This week, our guest is Detroit-based electronic musician [Phylum Sinter](http://flavors.me/phylum_sinter), a passionate artist whose free-flowing compositions feed energy, calm, and drive into the ears of fans everywhere.

I first learned of him during a promotional push for his album *Detroit Nocturnes*, which prominently featured the city's historic (but unused) [Michigan Central Station](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michigan_Central_Station) on the cover. The album also included a completely illegal live performance recording, captured on the station's thirteenth floor.

His music often combines elements that you wouldn't associate together, but in the end, always form a beautiful sonic tapestry. His next album *[Esc]* is expected soon, via [Hopskotch Records](http://hopskotchrecords.com).
