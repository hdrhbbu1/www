Four years ago is a long time, especially for creatives. With each year, we evolve: picking up new tricks that help us move forward. Four years ago, Lizzie Greco's now-thriving business was merely a dream. Fast forward to today, where her beautiful frames grace the walls of many Chicago establishments &mdash; including The Machine studio.

This episode is one of firsts: Lizzie's brand-new [Kickstarter](http://www.craftbelly.com/kickstarter) campaign launched a few days ago, and it is progressing towards the funding goal. It's also her first podcast appearance, and we're excited to make her a part of the Dispatch family.

Lizzie's signature frames do more than mark the edge of a print or painting, they extend it. If you're looking for a unique way to showcase your favorite pieces of art, you want a [Craftbelly](http://www.craftbelly.com) frame.
