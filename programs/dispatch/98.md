If you've emailed a journalist asking for a favor, thought of promoting your own work instead of hiring outside help, or are making anything (of any sort) that will eventually require promotion, listen up. This episode is for you.

It's difficult to believe that in 98 episodes of Dispatch, we've never covered self-promotion. Sure, we may have touched on it, but this show has never presented an accurate roadmap, a collection of steps that will (hopefully) lead you towards success... until now.

Listen closely as we walk through the four steps to successful (and responsible) self-promotion. This guide will help you contact journalists and other press employees with confidence, while also tempering your enthusiasm in a positive way. It's one thing to ask, but another to bother or nag. Learn the difference between the two in this hour long expose. It's the closest to a self-help guide that we'll ever get.
