  In the past, protecting your work meant limiting it's exposure. Licenses stood
  in the way, between what users could, or could not do. But in the internet
  age, if a creator wants to retain strict control, do these principals still
  hold true? Today on Dispatch, photographer Rich Myers joins Joshua and
  Nicholas for a lively conversation, where he describes a new approach to
  content licensing.

In the past, protecting your work meant limiting it's exposure. Licenses stood in the way, between what users could, or could not do. But in the internet age, if a creator wants to retain strict control, do these principals still hold true? Today on Dispatch, photographer [Rich Myers](http://richemyers.com) joins Joshua and Nicholas for a lively conversation, where he describes a new approach to content licensing.

A self-proclaimed documentarian, Rich recently returned from Ukraine, where he routinely put himself in harms way just for the one, magical photograph. [All of his work is available online, for free, to any visitor](http://richemyers.com/about/a-note-on-photo-presentation). Commercial clients (such as news organizations), however, will need to pay a licensing fee. Despite this distinction, all of his images are downloadable in full-resolution and un-watermarked, on his website. Is this the future of our digital work? How do we control the propagation of our art, in this digital realm? Can we control it?
