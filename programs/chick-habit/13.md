After months of coordination, we're finally proud to present the band behind our theme, [Blizzard Babies](https://www.facebook.com/blizzardbabies)! Formed in the winter months of two thousand eleven (and named for the snowstorm that blanketed our city), this band has been rocking the Windy City since. We discuss their career so far, and some of the very epic creations they've manufactured... including [this especially wild music video for "The Bus."](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ooDKObG7JkQ)

On another topic, here at Chick Habit HQ, there has been a changing of the guard. Ashly, like many talented entertainers before her, has left the building. In her stead, you're joined by [Annabel Lang](http://nicholaswyoung.com/people/annabel-lang) contributor to Dispatch, and Nicholas Young, founder of The Machine.

But even with a new (interim) team, Chick Habit is still the same show it always was. It's time for more of the awesome conversation that you expect: press play now.
