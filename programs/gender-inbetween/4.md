In this episode of Gender Inbetween, we host music critic and editor, Sasha Geffen. Listen closely for their commentary on patriarchal culture, shifting societal expectations as they moved into adulthood, and more.

"When I was a kid, I was always sort of masculine of center, especially 'for a girl'. ... When my hair was short, when I was little, people would assume I was a boy because I would wear things and opt for clothing that would be traditionally worn by boys in the early 90's. Kids don't have secondary sexual characteristics, so it's very easy to define your own gender."

"I didn't think much of it because 'tomboy' is an identity that girls are allowed to have. That's kind of one of the privileges of being assigned female is that when you deviate from the gender expectation, it's not a big deal because masculinity is not a big deal for anyone. It's something you can inhabit and people are just like 'well, she's just one of the boys,' and that's fine. It's not if you're assigned male, and you deviate from masculinity: it's more of a social infraction."
