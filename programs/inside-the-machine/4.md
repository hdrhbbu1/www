My guest for this episode is [Holley Maher](http://www.holleymaher.com), a multidisciplinary creator from Nashville, Tennessee. She has seen success in her music career with three successful releases, and placement in many different films. Her design business, *[H. Maher Creative](http://hmahercreative.com)*, is doing well, too.

We talk for just over an hour about her background, college experiences at Belmont University, whether to consider potential commercial success first when songwriting, and much more.

Her story intrigued me, mostly because she is so outgoing, and isn't willing to be anything other than herself. Her unwavering determination is inspiring, as she continues to innovate for the foreseeable future.
