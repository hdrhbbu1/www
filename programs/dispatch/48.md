Nicholas is sitting in the hot seat; a space normally occupied by our guest, while your hosts fire questions at them. In this episode, though, the tables turn and Joshua ends up interviewing his co-host about an upcoming product, [Mixdown](http://mixdown.co).

As Nicholas describes it, Mixdown is an innovative product with the potential to change how musicians monetize their art. Coffee shops, retail boutiques, restaurants &mdash; and most businesses that use music in their establishment &mdash; are currently in trouble. They must choose between the expensive licenses offered by performing rights organizations, or risk being sued for illegally using recorded music in their place of business. It's a choice that no small business should have to make.

Mixdown changes everything: artists are paid a fair rate for their output, and businesses are charged an inexpensive monthly fee. The solution is a simple one, but it took years to arrive here, where the service is almost ready for launch.

Joshua digs deep, and helps listeners understand the process that often happens deep within the recesses of his co-host's mind. Whether you're a musician, businessperson, or none of the above, listen and learn.
