Known for her contributions to [The Hush Sound](http://thehushsound.bandcamp.com), as a founding member of sunny rock act [Gold Motel](http://goldmotel.com), and most recently as the songwriter behind [Springtime Carnivore](http://springtimecarnivore.com), Greta Morgan is a friendly but powerful force in the independent scene.

I first discovered her work while living in Nashville, Tennessee, thanks to a CD in the mail that was postmarked with her Chicago address. Now with our headquarters in the Windy City, I knew she would eventually grace us with a visit Inside the Machine.

Today, we chat casually about her work in all three bands, and her frustrations, breakthroughs, and opinions on what it means to be a truly independent creator. Unfortunately, we also hear of Gold Motel's demise, but there are plenty of other, positive gems. Press play to experience this fantastic, one-hour anthology of Greta's life thus far.
