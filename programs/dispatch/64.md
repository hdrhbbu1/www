description: >-
  This week is a bit different than usual: your hosts are joined by Stephanie
  and Logan, members of the light-electronic band Voodoo Boogaloo. They're in
  town, wrapping up a 8-week tour with 7 shows in Chicago, so we asked them to
  stop by. In this episode, conversations about life on the road, and live
  performances from our special guests.

Life on the road is difficult: Sam McAllister of the indie-rock act [Project Film](https://www.facebook.com/projectfilmmusic) [once offered](https://machine.fm/inside/29) the advice that touring would either make or break your band. While it's not something to be taken lightly, it's also an important step for any band. For every musician, traveling is inevitable &mdash; so you may as well be good at it.

In the studio today are two guests, Stephanie and Logan of [Voodoo Boogaloo](http://voodooboogaloo.bandcamp.com). They're wrapping up week eight of their first tour, which has been a grueling, but educational experience. While in the Windy City, the band is performing seven times, so there's no excuse for local residents to miss them.

In this episode, we chat about the difficulties and triumphs of life on the road, and hear several live performances from our guests.
