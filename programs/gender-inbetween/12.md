In episode 12, of Gender Inbetween, Ashly D. (host of The Machine show, [*Chick Habit*](http://nicholaswyoung.com/programs/chick-habit)) discusses growing up and discovering club culture and her personal sexuality while doing battle with naysayers and people who have attempted to police her preferences and alignments.

"So, I come from a place where I wasn't even aware that there were gay people &mdash; or that it was an option, or that there were trans people &mdash; or anything different. It was a very small you know, heteronormative environment."

"... I present myself as very feminine. I always say that I'm a very girly girl; I like clothes, and make up, and shopping and all of the very, you know, what anyone would consider 'girly girl' stuff."

"I ran into a lot of people being like, 'Well, we think you're kind of a fake. We don't think you're actually gay or queer.' ... That was usually coming from other girls I was interested in, so that was a new shocker. I was like, 'Oh, if I want to be a lesbian, I have to dress a certain way, and act a certain way,' and that didn't make sense to me."
