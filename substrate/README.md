# [Substrate][newsletter]

Ray Kurzweil famously predicted [many technologies we consider commonplace
today.][predictions] If we are to discuss "the future" as a target to be hit, we
must learn to aim against the winds of futurism.

[Subtrate][newsletter] is an email newsletter designed to bridge the divide
between future technologies and now. I've spent a large part of my career
delivering insights on the radio or in an occasional social media post. We've
only seen the edge of how technology will revolutionize our society. I hope to
provide a forecast for anyone seeking that bright future.
