Today on Inside the Machine, Nicholas is joined by [Canasta](http://canastamusic.com), Chicago's hardest working pop act. They're crafting unique, hook-laden records that elevate your attitude and soul. Hailed as "a stalwart of orchestral pop" (Thomas Conner, Chicago Sun Times), and "the next big pop band out of Chi town" (Michael Morahan, Freio Music), this six-piece has garnered many kind quotes from the press and fans alike.

For the first time, the band is telling their entire story. This year is their fourteenth anniversary, so our two-hour plus show, covering the band's history, work, and future is appropriate. There's a lot of ground to cover, and of course, we spin tracks from four of their releases, including a fabulous remix album that is like no other.
