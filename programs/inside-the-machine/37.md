At the intersection of punk and electronic music, sits [Axons](http://axonsband.com). Calmly thumbing through the history of both genres &mdash; and examining the baggage associated with it &mdash; creator Adele Nicholas carefully grabs inspirational pieces from each genre. This is where the DIY ethos of punk, and the availability of electronic audio tools collide.

Started in the space between two active projects, Axons is a point of personal pride for Nicholas. It's a safe space where she can experiment wildly until a balance is struck. Also, her sonic maturity belies the true age of this project: it is barely a year old, and yet, is already a force to be reckoned with.

Press play, and prepare to enter the wonderful world of Axons. Inside the Machine starts now.
