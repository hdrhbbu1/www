[Matt Wertz](http://mattwertz.com) creates hook-laden indie pop that should be on your radar. If it isn't, you're missing out. He maintains a radio-ready confidence, yet retains an endearing authenticity. Matt's career is a instructional story on creating without limits, and making art on your terms.

In this hour-long interview Matt joins Nicholas to talk about his musical lineage, relationships with labels (both major and independent), a decade-plus of musicianship, and more.
