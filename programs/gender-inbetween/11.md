  Eugene Kalsted discusses growing up in an environment of gender based
  privilege where hetero normative tropes were the norm, much to his growing
  discomfort.

In episode 11, Eugene Kalsted talks about his upbringing in an environment where he was insulated as a seemingly straight male, finding the need to assimilate into that culture and saying regrettable things in order to fit in, all the while realizing how much we may very well have been talking just as much about himself.

"When you grow up around those kind of people and you get so used to acting a certain way, you kind of fall into habits like that. I've used certain rude terms to describe people, stuff that I really regret. I felt very hypocritical and it killed me, pointing fingers but not pointing it at myself."

Later, Eugene discusses revealing himself as queer and gay within the safety of the Chicago music community and how that liberation came with many great upturns, including acceptance from his bandmates, in his band, [Jolly Korea](https://jolly-korea.bandcamp.com) and his ability to write lyrics that reflected his experiences in a very real way.
