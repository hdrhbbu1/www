Genres can only reach so far. Hip-hop, rock, pop, and electronica all have their boundaries, and in today's world, most critics know where they are. A few months ago, Bode Radio entered our ears, and as a result, redefined what I consider music. Their work didn't fit neatly into a list of genres, and that's what we loved so much.

Spencer and Alex, collectively known as [Bode Radio](https://www.facebook.com/BodeRadio), fuse together elements of contemporary Indonesian music (Gamelan), rock, funk, hip-hop, and electronica in a wonderful, melodious trance. They blend so well, you can get lost in their mix, and forget that you're hearing multiple divergent styles. When combined with their auditory grab-bag of rare audio (voices, sampled drums and cue tones all somehow make their way in), and you've created the musical equivalent of modern art.

It's mesmerizing, and yet, accurately represents what it's like to be alive in a messy, cluttered world. You'll pull different emotions out of a single track, depending on your mood. Don't miss this wonderfully in-depth conversation at the fringe of music.
