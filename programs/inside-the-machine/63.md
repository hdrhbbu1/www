With so many genres lighting Chicago on fire, it's easy to forget the city's musical roots. As a close neighbor to Detroit, soul and jazz are integral parts of the Windy City's cultural dictionary, and today we speak with an artist who's working to preserve that history: [Lili K](http://lilikmusic.com).

Growing up in a home with classic Motown on the turntable, Lili was exposed to the work of jazz greats from an early age. As time passed, she was coached by a collection of helpful mentors, and eventually, unleashed her own brand of classic soul on her hometown of Milwaukee, Wisconsin.

Now living in Chicago, Lili has made a name for herself in the Second City, as an extremely talented performer and recording artist. Today, Lili recounts her story thus far to Inside the Machine.
