  Sometimes you need to stop your life for a while, and relax. With Nicholas
  going on vacation, it's time to encourage you to do so as well. In this
  episode, how to avoid burning out before you need rest.

Before Nicholas goes on vacation, your hosts are meeting in the studio so you don't go without a program. And since it's on our minds, we discuss how to avoid burning out before you need to rest.

Don't overexercise your creative muscles. Learn to stop, pause your activities, and relax. Burning the midnight oil may make you seem extraordinarily productive, but in too many sessions of insane, nonstop work can wear you out &mdash; and lead to subpar output. Learn to know your limits, and live within them.
