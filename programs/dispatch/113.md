Have you dreamt of taking a cross-country bicycle trip? If so, listen up. In this episode of Dispatch, our new friend Kellie Wyatt recaps her journey; one that began in Chicago, Illinois and ended in Astoria, Oregon.

Obviously, a trip like this can be riddled with problems. Imagine that you're back in the 90's playing *Oregon Trail*: a broken wheel waylaid Kellie and her companion for a few days, but other than a few flat tires, it seems that the adventure went smoothly. Nevertheless, she underscores the value of [planning your route](http://www.adventurecycling.org/routes-and-maps/adventure-cycling-route-network/transamerica-trail), and carrying a few basic supplies. Was this the trip of a lifetime? Listen to find out.
