In episode 14 of Gender Inbetween, Derek Muller discusses where they fall on the spectrum, and how activities that seem normal to them, may be foreign to others who live on the binary. But starting out here, how does Derek identify themselves?

"As fall as falling on the spectrum goes, I'm considering how trans I am, and if ever to transition to a trans-woman. At this moment, I fall into the 'cross-dresser' category, very clumsily. I have feelings about that... I don't identify with that word, because I just call it 'dressing.' It's just clothing."

"Otherwise, I don't know how to say it... I'm just not a guy, at all. I don't know how to describe it. I just don't have the words for it."

As mentioned in the episode, Derek recorded this while on tour with their band, [Whipped](https://whipped.bandcamp.com).
