[Evan McHugh](http://evanmchugh.com) is a writer of infectious pop melodies that stick in your head, spreading joy and beautiful sunlight. His new record, "Let's Be Young" just dropped, and I'm excited to share a few tracks with you. Of course, we also spin a couple of [older compositions](http://evanmchugh.com/albums) too.

When I lived in Nashville, Evan and I were fairly close, but never met. We operated in some of the same circles, but didn't even connect in passing. Today, I rectify that by hosting him for an hour and a half here on Inside the Machine.

## Featured Tracks

"Let's Be Young"

"From the Second Chair"

"I Want You More"

"You're So Bright"
