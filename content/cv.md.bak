After fifteen years as a mostly independent software consultant and educator, I'm ready to focus primarily on my time in the classroom. Since my first experience teaching robotics (while still in high school), I have made education a priority in my career. However, as an adolescent intrigued by software, I lacked a qualified mentor. This experience informs my belief that students of today deserve to be taught by industry professionals.

Technology's growing influence on every industry is obvious, and I hope to partner with an organization that is working to prepare students for the future of our industry with invaluable technical and intrapersonal skills.

### Core Skills

As an engineer, JavaScript, Elixir, React, Redux, ESLint, Webpack, Golang, FFmpeg, Docker,
Kubernetes, Neovim, and Alpine Linux are just a few of the tools I use
frequently. However, I have also been known to occasionally hack in C, Java,
Objective-C, Ruby, or PHP.

As a lecturer and educator, I have experience writing lesson plans both for
audiences of experienced professionals and newcomers. On the conference circuit,
you'll probably find me [speaking about JavaScript](/speaking/).

A detailed record of my professional experience can be found on

### Professional Goals

I am concerned about the growing impact of technology, and what it will mean for
future generations if a diverse group of leaders are not at the forefront.

Organizations of all sizes are using artificial intelligence and machine
learning techniques to glean value from stockpiles of cold data. [The
environment in which these algorithms
train](https://hbr.org/2016/11/teaching-an-algorithm-to-understand-right-and-wrong)
is incredibly important. By creating a welcoming and supportive environment for
all technologists, we ensure the algorithm trainers of tomorrow represent all of
humankind.
