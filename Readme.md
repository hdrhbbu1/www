The official website of photographer, filmmaker, and producer Nicholas Young.

## Goals

[GitHub](http://github.com) is the best place to host your project, period, open-source or otherwise. While I don't allow direct copying of the code in this repository, I want to share it here for the following reasons:

* Authoring semantic HTML and clean stylesheets can be hard, especially for newcomers to the world of web design. I was a novice once, and finding solid examples was difficult. I'm not perfect, and nor is this site, but I hope someone can learn from what I've authored.

* It's cool to look at other people's code, and see where you made a bad decision. Even for experienced developers, this is a moment of enlightenment.

* Closed systems suck. Even when I build private software, I try to share as many pieces as possible.

That said, please treat the intellectual property in this repo with respect. I trust that you will.
