Our guest this week is Megan Frestedt, co-founder of [Tandem Shop Records](http://home.tandemshoprecords.com), a independent label from Chicago. While other labels place comfortable bets on mildly successful acts, Tandem Shop focuses almost exclusively on unheard talent, and works tirelessly to build their audience.

She is also half of the indie-rock outfit Project Film, which, incidentally, is the band that spawned Tandem Shop, catapulting them from a dream to a functioning business entity. Today, we explore the complex and sometimes tulmultous relationship between artists and their label. Does every artist need help; what kind of acts does Tandem Shop seek out; and how do the labels co-founders know which new band to sign?

This episode is special, because it's our first live show with a studio audience. Andy from [Transistor](http://transistorchicago.com), was kind enough to offer usage of his space. We'll be recording at Transistor twice a month soon.
