We've all attended live performances, bought albums, then returned home to pop them in the CD player. Sometimes, we're disappointed by what we hear. In today's episode, Joshua and Nicholas grapple with this experience, ultimately posing the question: is art a consumer product? Can it be bought and sold like a physical item in a department store?

The basis for our discussion is [this journal entry](http://pwelverumandsun.tumblr.com/post/60972469293/customer-complaint) from P.W. Elverum & Sun. In it, he shares the letter of a disgruntled fan, and his response. For once, your hosts find themselves on opposite sides of the issue, but you can read the entry and decide for yourself.

Commodifying art is a risky proposition. As creators, we sell our work, and ourselves, daily. Does offering product for sale expose you to traditional customer complaints, as it does many other small businesses, or are we, as artists, exempt?
