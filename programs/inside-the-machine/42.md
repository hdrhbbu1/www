Here in Chicago, our local music scene is anything but normal. It welcomes those who are bent on reckless experimentation; some aiming for greatness, and others for the total deconstruction of their art form. Today, though, I bring you a band from the former category: [Spaces of Disappearance](http://spacesofdisappearance.com).

Founded amid the rubble of Elaine's previous band, Gag Order, Spaces of Disappearance has provided a home for the musical fragments that were otherwise out of place. Colorful rhythms, beefy synthesizers, and soaring vocals all find their place nestled amongst gritty fretless bass.

It's a one of a kind sound that you need to experience. My description cannot do it justice, so instead, I'll recommend this: press play to hear it now.
