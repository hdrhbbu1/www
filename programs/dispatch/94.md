Electronic commerce revolutionized what it means to make and sell handcrafted wares. However, we can't overlook the wonderful, physical stores that help artisans as well. In this episode of Dispatch, we discuss the role that brick and mortar stores play in our local economy.

Joining us for this conversation are two wonderfully talented friends: Kate Merena, owner of [Sacred Art](http://sacredartstore.com); and Emily Hamma Martin, organizer of [Show of Hands](http://showofhandschicago.com) and the creative powerhouse behind [Orange Beautiful](http://orangebeautiful.com). Together, we go deep into the world of retail, and how it boosts everyone's bottom line.

Once again, we're recording live at [Intuit: The Center for Intuitive and Outsider Art](http://art.org). If you haven't seen their expansive collection of unique works, don't miss it. It's worth making a trip to Chicago just to visit them.

Special thanks to Intuit for hosting us, and to [Annabel Lang](http://machine.fm/people/annabel-lang) for helping produce this live program.
