Is literature only what you read in a book? Think again. Today, Joshua and Nicholas are joined by [Carly Oishi](http://twitter.com/carlyo), co-creator of [Solo in the Second City](http://solointhe2ndcity.com), a live lit sensation covering the dating adventures of two Chicago writers.

In this hour, we discuss how she found the appropriate creative outlet for her talents, the perks of working as a nanny, and what's next for this talented author.

Her follow-up presentation, riding on the unexpected success of her last performance series, Miss Spoken is will be playing in Chicago later this year.
