  On this inaugural episode of Chick Habit, I'm joined by Shannon Candy and
  Nikita Word, frontwomen of the Chicago rock outfit, Strawberry Jacuzzi. Over
  the last few years, they've grown as a band, beginning as a small side project
  to gracing the front page of Pitchfork. We cover their triumphs, frustrations,
  and experiences in the Chicago music scene, what it's like to go on tour for
  the first time, and much more.
