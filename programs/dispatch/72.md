In a world of artistic miscreants, one man stands above them all. Where punk supplanted rock 'n' roll for the true rebels, he rose beyond the noise, riding on the tide of Chicago's growing independent music scene. Many years later, we find him working on pieces for The Black Keys, Phish, and Veruca Salt, alongside his own line of fine art prints. Of course, I'm talking about the one and only [Dan Grzeca](http://dangrzeca.com), creator of [Ground Up Press](http://groundup.bigcartel.com).

As fellow members of the Windy City art community, we're proud to call Dan a friend. To say that he's busy is a gross understatement: between spending time in his studio, with the family, and being on the road, he's constantly in motion. We've wanted him as a guest since the beginning, and now, over a year in, he's in the studio.

Tune in to hear the story of Dan's evolution as an artist, perspective on the worlds of art, music, life, and drugs.
