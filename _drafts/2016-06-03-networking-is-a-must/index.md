This is a message for both of us. By publishing this, I become a hypocrite. I don't go out as often as I should, I lose touch with valuable colleagues, and forget to follow-up.

Sure, [my condition](/life-on-the-inside) is partially to blame, but even though I am extroverted by nature, I have the tendency to stay home. There are times my absence from the outside world is positive: I lock in a goal, ignore distractions, and nail it. But for every one of those moments, I count a handful where I fell into the trap of discouragement and allowed my skills to tarnish.
