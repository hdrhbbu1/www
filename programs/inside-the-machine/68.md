"My teeth are made of motion picture film... okay. I open up my mouth, my thoughts are on display." So begins [Karmacoda](http://karmacoda.com)'s debut album, *Reco mended*, a broody affair that, little did the trio know, would kick off fifteen years of musical innovation.

The producer simply known as B. has served as a fearless leader, alongside vocalist Heather Pierce and bassist Eric Matsuno. What started out as an attempt to make music that, according to B., "the only person in the world who would like it was me." As we now know, it was exactly the opposite.

From their first record, through the latest, *Love and Fate, Vol. 1*, the band has never stopped experimenting. B., Heather, and Eric are still on fire, even all these years. Today on Inside the Machine, we start at the very beginning and walk through the band's unabridged history.
