  It's time to talk writing. This hour on Dispatch, Joshua and Nicholas are
  joined by Collin and Ben, founders and instigators of the Wasted Pages
  Writers' Workshop. Each week, they help fellow authors bone up on grammar,
  narrative storytelling, and everything else that makes a great work. We'll see
  if they can clean up our shownotes!

It's time to talk writing. This hour on Dispatch, Joshua and Nicholas are joined by Collin and Ben, founders and instigators of the [Wasted Pages Writers' Workshop](https://facebook.com/wastedpages). Each week at the [Chicago Publishers' Resource Center](http://chiprc.org), they help fellow authors bone up on grammar, narrative storytelling, and everything else that makes a great work. We'll see if they can clean up our shownotes!

Jokes aside, if you're a writer in the Windy City, you should attend one of their events. It's only $30, a presents a great opportunity to write and be critiqued in a safe, constructive environment. Plus, laying down that cash will (hopefully) motivate you to draft your next masterwork.
