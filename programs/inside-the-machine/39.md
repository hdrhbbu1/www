  flourished into a long-running project with dedicated fans, spread all across

  soon.

Turn it up! This week, Nicholas hosts Chicago alt-rock band [The Wild Finish](http://thewildfinish.com), in a hard-edged episode brimming with loud music, constructive criticism of the Chicago music scene, and many, many expletives.

The band began, like most projects, as an experiment. Ryan, the band's founder, was a hobbyist songwriter &mdash; with his artistic pursuits taking a backseat to the day job as print coordinator for a poster design company. Eventually, he shared his work with his friends, who immediately latched onto the project.

Several years (and multiple lineup changes) later, The Wild Finish is a strong three-piece act poised for exponential growth. With a strong, core fan base scattered across the midwest, they don't plan on stopping. They're the juggernauts of Chicago rock, so get out of the way.
