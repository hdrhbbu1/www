Call it what you will, but it's a fact. Success has never, not on even your luckiest day, stepped out into the daylight. It's elusive, and therefore, worth the chase.

Entrepreneurs, Artists, Investors &mdash; all visionaries in their own disciplines &mdash; often spend decades in pursuit, only to fall short. Dreams shatter, and money is lost. This leaves a vacant space where heartache can reside. And unless you're on constantly on guard, it will.

Allowed to run rampant, it will fill your psyche with a framed portrait of every time you failed. Success is the only antidote, which, oddly, comes with a high price of it's own.

Success doesn't lie at the end of a straight, well-paved road. If it did, everyone would have drove in, parked in the open lot, and proceeded to live happily ever after. No, it's the winding, sacrificial road that takes us to the wilderness, one that happens to be marginally closer to success than our starting location. Additionally, moving a mile can take years, or a matter of hours, depending on your skill. It isn't fair, but that's the game you entered. It's the game you must play.

Dedicated players of this game spend many late nights honing a craft in secret. They live, eat, and breathe a singular mission, forsaking all but their basic needs, to pursue an unpopular course of action, all while trusting the payout will come.

And they love it.

Walking on a razor thin line between crushing defeat and adoration is thrilling for some; the risk draws them in. Artists, naturally, savor the time-honored act of of self-expression for profit. For entrepreneurs, it's the chance to invent a sustainable, profitable business from, well, nothing. Investors often are drawn in by the potential for 10x returns on invested capital.

In other words, risk can be thrilling, if taken soberly. There are times when the opportunity for failure is high, but so is the payout should you succeed. In those moments, you determine if the risk is worth it.
