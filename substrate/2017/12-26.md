Welcome to the inaugural edition of Substrate. I'll be your editor and
guide, Nicholas Young.

Substrate is an email newsletter, not entirely unlike ones you've read
before, I expect. Except this time, we stir together a mixture
comprised of op-ed pages, technical news, disability rights, and an
unabashed Kurzeilian vein of futurism.

It is the digital forecast: a supplement of knowledge from which to
build the next generation of social, technical ventures.

Every Tuesday, I'll share news, tutorials, and perspectives that
challenge existing conventions. It's my job to make you think.
