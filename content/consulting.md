I have bolstered technical teams, mastered audio, photographed nationally
recognized recording artists, convinced others to release work as Creative
Commons, produced short films, and built products end-to-end.

I'm a generalist who thrives in multi-disciplinary environments, and my
involvement in mass media, production, technology, and marketing all represent different
lenses that I can use to refocus a given problem and suggest actionable solutions.
For starters, I can help you:

## Launch a meaningful product with a maintainable tech stack

Balancing between my experience with several
[languages, programming paradigms, and design systems,](/about/) we will
discuss your product with an eye on the technical requirements while playing to
your team's existing strengths. Both new products and existing ones are welcome
to apply.

## Successfully engage media outlets or create an in-house content team

If the goal is engaging relevant media outlets, I've seen both sides: as the
pitcher, and media figure being pitched. This experience helps craft an
empathetic, effective campaign. If you require an internal content team, media
is what I do best: from studio design to production training, I can make the
process painless.

If none of the above services are appealing, feel free to bring your own big
questions. [Let's explore how I can help.](/contact)
