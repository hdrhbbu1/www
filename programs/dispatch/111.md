Meet our new friend [Subi Shah](http://svbi.me). A mechanical engineer by day, she's into 3D printing, and building items with her hands. Recently, she took on the challenge of teaching herself how to code, a respectable pursuit, and one that caught our attention. Sure, it's one thing to master your craft, like the artisans of yesteryear, but it requires extraordinary drive to take on a new discipline.

Today, we chat about her decision to learn by experimenting, how debugging can be the most rewarding task in all of software development, and why it's important to never stop learning.
