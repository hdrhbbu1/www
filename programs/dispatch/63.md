If 2013 was the year for founding podcast networks, Patrick O'Rourke was ahead of the curve. Two years ago, he founded the (now) popular network, [Peaches and Hot Sauce](http://peachesandhotsauce.com). Together with his team of producers, he's responsible for some of Chicago's finest improv comedy productions.

Several weeks ago, Nicholas, one of your hosts, had the opportunity to [join him for Making New Friends](http://peachesandhotsauce.com/podcasts/making-new-friends/better-than-jerky) (Patrick's main show), and witness his excellence first hand.

Today, Patrick joins Joshua and Nicholas for an extended discussion around podcast networks, the business (and work!) behind them, and his money-stuffed mattress. He's making serious bank, and (for some unknown reason) wants to share his wisdom with you. Don't miss this riveting hour of radio!
