"At this point, Kickstarter is probably the most important thing that's happened in my life," says [Max Temkin](http://maxistentialism.com). You may not know his name, but you certainly know his work. Max is a major creative force behind [_Cards Against Humanity_](http://cardsagainsthumanity.com), and [_Humans Versus Zombies_](http://humansvszombies.org), two runaway successes in the world of gaming. His work on Barack Obama's 2008 presidential campaign is no small credit either.

Max has launched one successful project after another, thanks to the magic of crowdfunding. He says it "removes the risk" from creative projects, and thanks to the all-or-nothing funding model, ensures demand for the product once it's released.

In this episode, Joshua and Nicholas are joined by The Maxistentialist himself, to talk about his Kickstarter successes, the new creative economy, and of course, the biggest failures of his career thus far. In this hour, you'll learn how Max designs, ships, and promotes his creations. It's real talk, aimed at helping you, and unlike anything else you'll hear this week: so dress up, we're going to school &mdash; Kickstarter school, that is.
