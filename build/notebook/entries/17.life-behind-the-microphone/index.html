<p>Adults always told me that time would pass faster as I aged. Now, several years into the largest venture I've undertaken thus far, I understand.</p>
<p>Two years ago, I pressed record. Two years ago, I spoke into a microphone, kicking off my return to broadcasting. &quot;Welcome to Dispatch,&quot; I said. My co-host, Joshua Wentz was present for this landmark moment, and has stayed the course alongside me for these past hundred-plus episodes.</p>
<p>That opening phrase was more than the beginning of a new show; it marked the beginning of a movement much bigger than myself, now known across the globe as The Machine. Over the last two years, we've created almost 400 pieces of innovative, educational audio programming — some that I believe is the best in it's class. We gathered the most intelligent audience too: artists, entrepreneurs, designers, musicians, and creative individuals of all types tune in every month for their weekly dose of stimulating conversation on some of the most pressing matters facing our culture today. The team — Ashly, Kriss, Joshua,</p>
<p>The Machine is unafraid, always willing to push the envelope and touch topics that other mediums consider as too controversial. Exploration and conversation are core elements in our DNA. We've always been driven by curiosity, and now it's time for our second act.</p>
<p>Last month The Machine turned two. It was a celebration of how far we've come, but still, there is work left to be done.</p>
