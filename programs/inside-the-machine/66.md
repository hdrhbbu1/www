It may have taken a few years, but once [Evie Archer](http://eviearcher.com) decided to pursue her dream as an artist, things changed forever. This North Jersey native has already released &mdash; in just over a one year span &mdash; her debut album, including a single that reached twenty-ninth place on the Adult Contemporary radio charts, and an original Christmas track which saw airplay on Sirius/XM.

We first encountered Evie thanks to Twitter, and picked up her full album for airplay on [The Machine](http://machine.fm/live). Soon thereafter, we struck up a conversation and booked her appearance on Inside the Machine. Even in the month that spanned between our initial conversation and today's show, Evie has been hard at work booking shows, coordinating the release of her new album, and much more. If we could pick artists who are most likely to succeed in 2015, Evie would be among the top selections.

Presented here for the first time, you'll get to hear Evie's full story, and the world premier of several new tracks off her forthcoming EP, *Chocolate and Whiskey*. What started as a conversation on Twitter has now become almost two-hours of fine radio entertainment. Press play to experience the magic and mastery of this talented new artist.
