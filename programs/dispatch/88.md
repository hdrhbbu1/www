How do you grow as an artist? Can you adopt a regimen of tasks that help you stretch outside of your comfort zone? In this hour, we examine how we have grown, and suggest ideas that will help expand your range of talents well outside their current boundaries.

In the world of Dispatch, we're beginning to [tackle live remote shows on the air](http://dispatch-live.eventbrite.com). If you're interested to see how we pull this off, come and join us next week in Chicago.

We also want to hear about tasks or things you do to become a better creator. Let us know at 1 (844) 4-MACHINE. Record your stories, and we'll play them on the show.
