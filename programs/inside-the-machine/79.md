It's one hit after another! In this episode of Inside the Machine, Nicholas visits with Mel from Chicago-funk-rock outfit [The Golden Rule](http://therealgoldenrule.com).

In just over an hour, Mel dishes on everything from his early years in bands, how to find reliable bandmates, why producing an album yourself might be the right choice (versus going into the studio with a producer) and much more. Plus, you won't want to miss his extremely motivational (and explicit) speech for potential artists near the show's end.

Put on your headphones (or climb on the couch near your radio), because it's time to rock. Episode 79 of Inside the Machine is comin' at you now!
