One of the newest tools in my box is [Elixir](http://elixir-lang.org), a language from the mind of former [Rails](http://rubyonrails.org) Core Team member and Ruby consultant JosÃ© Valim. Even for seasoned engineers, it offers a refreshing, modern functional syntax and is built on [BEAM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erlang_(programming_language)), the Erlang Virtual Machine.

Some might say it's reinventing the wheel, because, after all, you could just use Erlang. You surely could, but with a newly minted, viable alternative, should you?

> Erlang is a Ferrari wrapped in the sheet metal of an old beater. It has immense power, but to many people, it looks ugly.

That phrase was written by Paul Smith for thoughtbot's [*Giant Robots*](https://robots.thoughtbot.com/testing-a-phoenix-elixir-json-api) blog, and it perfectly describes why you might want to consider writing Elixir over it's predecessor. And yes, while I'm speaking technically, let's be clear: Elixir doesn't replace Erlang: instead, it compliments it very nicely. However, my point remains; most of you will never need to author a library or application in pure Erlang.

But this post isn't about Erlang, or even Elixir. No, we're tackling a much bigger topic... a topic that pulls us away from the microcosmic orbit of programming languages, their runtimes, and communities. I want to talk today about reinventing the wheel.
