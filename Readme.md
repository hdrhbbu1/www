The official website of voice-over actor, photographer, filmmaker, and producer Nicholas Young.

## Developing

This site is built on top of
[Gatsby](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/tree/1.0/) 1.0, a React-powered
static site generator.

### Getting Started

To begin, install all dependencies with npm, like usual: `npm install`.

Once installation is complete, you can run `npm run develop`, which will start a
development server on [`localhost:8000`](http://localhost:8000) and begin
watching for changes.

When you're done, build the site with `npm run build`, and deploy with `npm run
deploy`.

### Authoring New Posts

`npm run new-post` will ask several questions, the answers to which will be used
to create a new post template.
