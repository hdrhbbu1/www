I redesign this site annually, but this iteration is radically different. Normally, I pick a new set of technical tools and work around any associated oddness they might introduce &mdash; however, this time, I decided to be bold. I reimagined my personal design language, employed a simple file-based CMS, and picked a new hosting provider. Like I said, bold.

However, this post isn't about technical details alone. It's part of a (text: much larger narrative link: /notebook/its-not-about-your-tools) on choosing the right tools: ones that help you create better work.

## Design Language

Design is art and science, wrapped together in a single, cohesive package. Colors, font choices, line spacing, and menu structure all play a crucial role in this careful dance. Design language is a term coined to reflect the collective effect of each decision, and it's impact on the viewer.

If I choose the wrong font or size it incorrectly, my message is garbled. When in the studio, I ensure the vocalist can be heard, and this is no different. In fact, it could be even more important. The web is full of poorly designed sites, and their message suffers as a result. If a viewer cannot easily read your content, then they'll leave. I know my audience: you don't surf aimlessly and land here: any visit is intentional, and I should treat you wish respect.

For this redesign, I stripped my layout bare, only including essentials: clean typography, a spacious layout, and simple navigation. I decided upfront to nix any extraneous elements.
