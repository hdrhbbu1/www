Most of our programs focus on a single artist or entrepreneur, working for a company of one. Our guest today manages a much larger endeavor.

John Rood, founder of [Next Step Test Preparation](http://nextsteptestprep.com), while based in Chicago, manages an internationally distributed team of employees and clients. By only offering one-on-one training, Next Step has differentiated itself from the competition, and is able to offer far greater return on the student's investment.

John founded the company just over 4 years ago, and has experienced exponential growth in that timespan. He joins Joshua and Nicholas to discuss how he grew his business, while remaining authentically involved in the lives of his clients.
