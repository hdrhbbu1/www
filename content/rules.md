In fact, you'll find opinions spanning medical, technological, and cultural topics all on display here. While reading, though, please keep the following in mind:

**Nothing on this website should be considered a replacement for professional
advice.**

While articles on this site frequently concern the skepticism most doctors
exhibit before their patients, I want to stress that everything I've written
(and will write) is from my perspective alone and does not represent
professional advice or services in any form.
