I'm a consummate creator. Ideas pop into my head, and I have to deal with them somehow. Most of the time, they're crap, and end up tossed away. Occasionally though, some are worth building. Take a look.

Mixdown:
	title: Mixdown
	description: Licensing music for commercial playback can be difficult, especially if you dislike popular, top-40 hits - until now. Mixdown allows businesses to pick a genre and stream any genre they like, and all plays directly support the artists!

	title: Urbanscapes: Beauty in the Broken
	description: City dwellers accept that portions of their beloved home are broken and undesirable to some. Through this collaboration with frame designer (link: http://www.craftbelly.com text: Lizzie Greco), I hope to open their eyes, and encourage them to look everywhere. The city is beautiful, even in it's brokenness.
