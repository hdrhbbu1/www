If you have questions, comments, or want to collaborate on a project - I'm always listening. However, due to the amount of email I receive, I have a few guidelines. Please follow them, as it will help me respond to your request in a timely manner.

If you're an artist looking for publicity, feel free to send demos to the address listed below. I try to listen to any submitted recordings, but can't guarantee a response. If you're a good fit for (link: http://originalmachine.com text: Original Machine)'s artist roster, I'll contact you. If you're a recruiter trying to fatten your address book or pitch a job, I'm not interested. If you want to pitch your company, try to meet me in person at a local event.
