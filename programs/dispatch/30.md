Every band has a story. It deserves to be told and documented, as any piece of important history should be. Kriss Stress is Chicago's foremost documentarian, focusing on the growing independent music scene. Their blog, record label, and podcast all operate under the [*Notes and Bolts*](http://www.notesandbolts.com) banner &mdash; serving as a one-stop shop for anyone wishing to learn more about the Windy City's music culture.

In this hour of Dispatch, Joshua and Nicholas are joined by Kriss to discuss their work (both on *Notes and Bolts*, and as a visual artist), plus failed projects, how to recover from a misstep, and much more.
