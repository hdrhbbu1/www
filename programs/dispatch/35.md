Have you ever considered creating sounds for videogames, ad campaigns, or theatre? Today's guest, [Joel Corelitz](http://joelcorelitz.com), has scored all of these and more. He's the founder of [Waveplant Studios](http://waveplantstudios.com), a bespoke audio curation outfit on the outskirts of Chicago.

We chat about his work thus far, including the frustrations and struggles of working in a loosely-defined creative field like sound design, how he rose to work for international brands, and his recent decision to "de-brand" and separate his name from that of his company.

Put this in your ears, and pick up some new knowledge. Dispatch 35 is on the air.
