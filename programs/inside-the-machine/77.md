It's time to go in-depth with one of Nashville's most innovative acts. The brainchild of songwriter Sam Tinnesz, [Wave & Rome](http://waveandrome.com) represents a new group of talent emerging from the Music City's ever-expanding independent music scene. On his debut EP, "Across the Map", Sam pairs folk songwriting with driving beats... a combination that we haven't heard before.

Like usual, we start with Sam's foundation as an artist, building up from his time in Atlanta, just south of Athens, Georgia's undisputed music capital. After his relocation to Nashville, everything changed. Sam found himself in a totally new city, where expectations were even higher than before. Never one to give up, he rose to the challenge and was soon penning tracks for friends, including [Ruelle](https://twitter.com/ruellemusic), a talented artist who you'll hear from in a future episode of [*Inside the Machine*](http://machine.fm/inside).

In this almost two-hour conversation, we explore the difference between writing songs for other artists versus yourself, how Nashville's independent music scene has grown over the years, and how young artists should hone their craft. You'll learn something, guaranteed.
