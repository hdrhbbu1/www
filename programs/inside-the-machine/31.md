It began with the need to hide. To steal away from academia, and relax in a safe space. In college, Aaron Rosell would book a practice room and perform for himself alone. His home was a musical place, but he never considered the place songwriting had in his life, so it remained a hobby; an escape from the mundane crawl of normal life.

But once his friends discovered this practice, they encouraged him to share. This process took a while, but over the years, Aaron has meticlously crafted a collection of two albums that stand above the noise, bringing hope and peace to the listener. His lyrics gently soothe lingering questions, and address the very meaning of life itself.

In this hour, you'll learn more about Aaron and his solo project, [He Who Never](http://hewhonever.com). The coffee is brewed, and the recorders are on. Let's have a chat.
