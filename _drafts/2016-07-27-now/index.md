I'm slowly exiting a chaotic period: learning to balance parenting with professional goals is never easy, but I'm simultaneously also reckoning with several other life events. We ([Susan](http://susandyoung.com), [Sloan](sloanayoung.com), and I) relocated to Denver, Colorado in mid-June; I'm learning new treatments for my [escalating chronic pain;](/life-on-the-inside) and there's the mess known as unpacking.

This month's goals are to focus, and return [Mixdown.co](http://mixdown.co) to the spotlight, under the guise of my new company, [Uptime Ventures](http://uptime.ventures).

## Upcoming

I need to get back out on the road. Speaking is a prominent part of my educational strategy, both for myself and the audience, but I had to relax my schedule during this time.

I hope to begin by attending several local events.
