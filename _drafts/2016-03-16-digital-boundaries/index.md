Today, in the United States of America, we held our major party primaries. For the uninitiated, this is the process through which major party candidates are chosen. On the Democratic side, we can choose from Bernie Sanders, a Democratic Socialist senator from Vermont, or Hillary Clinton, former Secretary of State, and First Lady. The Republicans have unleashed a diverse stable of potential candidates, many of whom I don't follow. Outside of the debacle that is Donald Trump's campaign, I hardly know what to think about it all.

Ideologically, I'm an independent. I vote on the issues, and hope that the candidate's party does the same. My political upbringing emphasized that contestants, delegates, and party leaders all must stick to the defined platform &mdash; and if they did, it was safe to vote the [party line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Party-line_vote). Of course, this is rarely the case, which led to my political unhinging early in adulthood.

If pressed, I would like to see an honest politician, whether defined by their past career moves or not, run outside of the two-party system and win; mostly because of the precedent it could set. But I'm not naÃ¯ve: I know the odds favoring this outcome are exceptionally slim.

Maybe we could get a common-sense candidacy out of the usual political machine? This year, more than I've ever seen before, the citizenry is ready for a revolt.

This post isn't about politics, really. I assume you've been topped off on punditry and opinion, courtesy of the talking heads on one of our nonstop news channels. It's a shame, really, that their twenty-four-seven bully pulpit can't be put to better use... but I suppose that's what the internet is for.

No, this isn't about a high stakes political showdown where our ideological selves face off against one another. Instead, I want to remind you to mind the tenets of basic digital courtesy. I think you can handle that, right? It's relaxing and corrective, for both of us.

> Your right to swing your arms ends just where the other man's nose begins.

Written by [Zechariah Chafee](https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Zechariah_Chafee) in his 1919 Harvard Law Review publication, [*Freedom of Speech in Wartime*](http://www.jstor.org/stable/1327107?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents), this is a common phrase used to explain the freedom that most of us enjoy here in America and around the world. It demonstrates how you, as an individual, family unit, or organization, are allowed to exercise your legally guaranteed rights to unfettered speech and expression.

In most situations, this right is clearly defined and never to be challenged. But if your speech (or expression of that speech) defames someone else with baseless slander, then you have legal concerns to worry about.

If you need help determining the difference between your options, refer to the golden rule: *treat others as you would want to be treated*.

It's obvious where our boundaries should lie when we're in the same physical space as another person, but where should we draw our digital boundaries? How can you, a passionate, but also courteous communicator, ensure they're respected? Here are my basic rules:

**If it feels wrong, it probably is.**

**Keep it in your network.**

**Don't poke the bear.**

**Let ideas be the winning card.**
