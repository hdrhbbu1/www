  Fresh off the National Stationary Show in NYC, Joshua and Nicholas offer
  advice to businesses and creators who might be considering exhibiting their
  wares.
---
There's a time to show off your work, and a time to stay quiet. But once you decide to exhibit your wares, that's far from the last decision you'll need to make.

Joshua has returned to Chicago, after a weeklong sojourn to NYC for the [National Stationary Show](http://www.nationalstationeryshow.com), primed and ready to walk through his experience. In this episode, both of your hosts offer reasoned perspectives on the world of trade shows: how they can benefit (or harm) your business, and what you should consider prior to setting up a booth for the world to see.
