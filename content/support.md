My current goal is to reform and expand how rare illnesses and disabilities are presented
in contemporary journalism outlets. I do this by adding context to stories,
adding to the original media [criticism](/tags/criticism/) pieces that have
always been a staple of [my writing](/2017/06/shades-of-rare-illness) and
previously, [on the airwaves](/programs/dispatch/) as well.

While the medium has changed (and undoubtably will be reshaped by whatever mass
media phenomonon arrives next), the work remains.

Seeing articles from the perspective of a rare illness patient on Twitter is always appreciated. That obviously goes for media that I produce, but also the work of any other creators.

Media criticism doesn't pay (yet), and I'm currently working to re-enter the job market while fighting an uphill battle with ableism in the tech industry. Even a few bucks will help me keep writing and advocating.
