After fifteen years as a mostly independent software consultant and educator, I'm ready to focus primarily on my time in the classroom. Since my first experience teaching robotics (while still in high school), I have made education a priority in my career. However, as an adolescent intrigued by software, I lacked a qualified mentor. This experience informs my belief that students of today deserve to be taught by industry professionals.

Technology's growing influence on every industry is obvious, and I hope to partner with an organization that is working to prepare students for the future of our industry with invaluable technical and intrapersonal skills.

### Core Skills

As an engineer, JavaScript, Elixir, React, Redux, ESLint, Webpack, Golang, FFmpeg, Docker,
Kubernetes, Neovim, and Alpine Linux are just a few of the tools I use
frequently. However, I have also been known to occasionally hack in C, Java,
Objective-C, Ruby, or PHP.

As a lecturer and educator, I have experience writing lesson plans both for
audiences of experienced professionals and newcomers. On the conference circuit,
you'll probably find me [speaking about JavaScript](/speaking/).

A detailed record of my professional experience can be found on
[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nicholaswyoung).

### Professional Goals

I am concerned about the growing impact of technology, and what it will mean for
future generations if a diverse group of leaders are not at the forefront.

The usage of artificial intelligence and machine learning will only increase
from here. Reading the [writings of noted Futurist Ray
Kurzweil](http://www.kurzweilai.net/we-could-get-to-the-singularity-in-ten-years), one gets the impression that we are incredibly close to the technological singularity. As technology moves closer to home, industry leadership should mirror the wider world. We have a long way to go.
