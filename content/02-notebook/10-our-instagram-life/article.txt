Tweet. Post. Comment. This era has it's own lingo; a jargon-addled psuedolanguage that sometimes barely resembles recognized speech or written words. Children, teenagers, and adults alike all speak it, as everyone desperately tries to capture fleeting memories with limited characters of text, or a likely blurry photograph. Most attempts fail, falling short of the glorious moment when they were written or snapped.

Whenever I board the train, I'm surrounded by passengers craning their neck downward to catch up on the latest news. As if made from stone, they sit still while the city whizzes past, only rising immediately before exiting at their appointed stop. At concerts, when the focus should be on the performer, their phones are in the air, recording every song, knowing fullwell the resulting video will only a pixelated mess.

This behavior is universally recognized, repeating itself daily without fail, seemingly controlled by a greater mind. We behave as the program instructs &mdash; peering through dark portholes into lives of our virtual friends, and ignoring our own.

In a world where everyone is searching for creative fulfillment and avenues for personal expression, as a society, we've lied to ourselves. We said anyone with something to say should say it, but those with something to say are simply loudmouths with no substance. We're spinning ourselves crazy, trying to capture every moment, and find ourselves living through a 3x5 glass panel.
