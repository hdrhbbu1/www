From his home base of Nashville, Tennessee, Dalton Diehl is launching an all-out assault on EDM culture. If you think modern dance music has a certain undeniable vibe, prepare to experience fresh beats, honest songwriting, and grit &mdash; the likes of what we haven't seen since the invention of the synthesizer.

[Young Brother](http://youngbrothermusic.com) is the second project from Diehl, whose roots are historically in one of Music City's most dominant genres: religious, praise and worship power ballads. His new EP, *Kamikaze*, is more than a step forward, it's a leap into the unknown.

Today on Inside the Machine, we discuss his exit from the world of CCM ("Contemporary Christian Music"), how arbitrary metrics and business practices ruin good art, and more.
