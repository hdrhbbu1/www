In a world where we all tap incessantly at our smartphones, what makes a truly useful application? [Sam Vermette](http://samvermette.com), CEO and co-founder of [Transit App](http://thetransitapp.com) knows. In this episode of Dispatch, he shares how Transit became one of the dominant players in a crowded space.

For the uninitiated, Transit App helps city dwellers track availability and schedules for multiple transportation methods: in most areas, the application supports buses, trains, and bike share networks. It runs on iOS and Android, so regardless of your platform, you will still arrive on-time at your destination. And when compared to other applications, it's surprisingly minimal. "It's pretty rare that you can brag about having a low session length in average," says Vermette. "But in our case, that's exactly what we're shooting for." On average, a Transit user only keeps the app open for a maximum of twenty seconds. Longer session times are a symptom of complex applications, something Sam wants no part of.
