Join one band, and your might fill artistically fulfilled. Start a second, and your free time begins to wane. Add in other exciting musical projects, and you become like our guest, Dale Price.

Dale is well-known fixture in the Chicago music scene, as he performs with two popular groups ([Dayman](https://www.facebook.com/daymanchicago), and [Prom Night](http://www.promnightband.com)), a collaborator to many more artists, and a friend to all. (He's also an avid JavaScript programmer, who understands how our setup here at [The Machine](http://machine.fm) works.)

If you juggle multiple bands (or even just artistic outlets, be it graphic design, programming, or music), then this show is for you. Obviously, each project requires a certain amount of time &mdash; but there are only 24-hours in each day, and for a large portion of those, you must sleep. How does Dave wrangle all of his projects? Listen to find out.
