  It's time to talk writing. This hour on Dispatch, Joshua and Nicholas are
  joined by Collin and Ben, founders and instigators of the Wasted Pages
  Writers' Workshop. Each week, they help fellow authors bone up on grammar,
  narrative storytelling, and everything else that makes a great work. We'll see
  if they can clean up our shownotes!
