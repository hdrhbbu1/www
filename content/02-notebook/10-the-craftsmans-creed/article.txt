Most creators, regardless of medium, adhere to an internal code of conduct. This list of basic rules governs their creative output, ensuring quality and artistic honesty. In my opinion, drafting these guidelines is a required step before embarking on a creative career.

My friends know that I have a rather stringent set of rules. Even strangers, in casual conversation, have encountered them - and certainly you, dear reader, have as well through articles on this site. Until now, my exact standards have remained private; kept in my mind and recalled for myself only in times of need &mdash; but after much contemplation, I decided to share them here.

While the notes below won't apply to everyone, I believe they can be easily generalized. I wrote them in first person, as recalled many times over. So, without any further discussion, I give you *The Craftsman's Creed*.

## Sleep On It

Creative work is the process of gathering disparate elements and arranging them to form a cohesive presentation. I will rarely, if ever at all, release work into the world without contemplating the results that it will have on myself, my career, a societal group, or the world at large.

## Use Your Medium Wisely

My creation will affect anyone who is exposed to it. More specifically, any viewer is exposed to my opinion, which is an inherent part of every piece of art. I will always carefully consider any messages I communicate to the observer through my art, and do my best to never mislead anyone who comes into contact with it. If my work is fiction, it should be easy to recognize it as such.
