  A landmark. When you move from double to triple digits, for any creative
  project, it's a reason for celebration. This, friends, is episode one hundred
  of Dispatch, featuring an all-new theme and audio branding, but us, Joshua and

A landmark. When you move from double to triple digits &mdash; for creative project &mdash; it's a reason for celebration. This, friends, is episode one hundred of Dispatch, featuring an all-new theme and audio branding, but us, Joshua and Nicholas, remain. We will always be here to provide you with ample doses of educational and thought provoking conversation... We're just older and wiser now.
