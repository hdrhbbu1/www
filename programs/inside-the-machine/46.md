  Removing (or replacing) reeds in a pipe organ might seem like blasphemy to
  some, but for Coppice, it's a daily task that forwards their career. Born in
  2009, this Chicago duo is pressing forward, and creating sounds that capture
  the raw emotional power of audio. Today, they join Nicholas in-studio for
  Inside the Machine.

Removing (or replacing) reeds in a pipe organ might seem like blasphemy to some, but for [Coppice](http://www.futurevessel.com/coppice), it's a daily task that forwards their career. Born in 2009, this Chicago duo is pressing forward, and creating sounds that capture the raw emotional power of audio. Today on Inside the Machine, hear the sounds of a few of their most divergent works, *Vantage Cordoned*, *Big Wad Excisions*, and *Soft Crown*.

If you're ready for more. Ready to hear what music can be, rather than just what it is, press play.
