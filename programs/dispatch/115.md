This week, Joshua and Nicholas are hanging in the studio with Redeye Columnist and Chicago's Chief Geek, [Elliott Serrano](http://geektome.net). Elliott is the driving force behind the Geek To Me blog, a writer for the Grumpy Cat and Army of Darkness comic series. He's been dubbed "Chicago's King of Geeks" and "Rebel Scum" by several prominent figures in the world of geek media, and today, his voice finally debuts on Dispatch.

In this hour, they cover what it means to be dubbed a "geek" (both now and in the past), the evolving nature of comics and movie journalism, plus Elliott offers a unique look behind the scenes at comic series that you might know and love.
