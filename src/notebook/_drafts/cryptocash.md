subtitle: Understanding what money truly is.

Cash, and the ideas it represents, controversies that surround it, and desire to possess mounds of it have always fascinated me. Even as a child, I marveled at this green-tinted paper, wondering what differentiated it from white inkjet stock and flimsy yellow legal pads.

I always realized my parents had enough of it to live comfortably, but never the amount they desired. Like everyone else, they stored it in a bank, which I later learned safeguarded large piles of the stuff for millions of depositors. Iniquisitively, I wondered why bank robberies were so common, if banks were supposedly a safe place for your samoleans.
