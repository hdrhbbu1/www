All creators will fail sometime during their career. If you haven't yet, wait. The test of a successful artist is how they continue after a shortcoming. Did their inner turmoil and frustration destroy their work, or were they able to bounce back to near perfection?

In this very personal episode, Joshua and Nicholas dive into their personal failures, hoping that you learn and avoid their mistakes.
