This week on Dispatch, a news-roundup loaded with off-base comments from popular artists and tech entrepreneurs. This begged us to ask, when your opinion matters, what should (or shouldn't) you be allowed to say? How can creatives speak constructively, without unnecessarily tearing down their fellow man, but also with honesty?

Listeners, as your career grows, be sure to mind what you say. Because it might just come back to you.
