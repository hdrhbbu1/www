In another episode from our archive, Nicholas speaks with Christina DeNee and Scott Calandra of the Buffalo, New York duo [Breakerbox](http://breakerbox.tv). This interview was recorded during a unique time of their career, immediately following the release of their debut album, *These Are Strange Days*.

Fast forward to today, and they're still making waves with a signature blend of soulful, guitar-fronted rock and roll. Will their upward trajectory ever stop? I certainly hope not.

If you're looking for a blueprint to success, Christina and Scott are an act to follow. Their popularity is a testament to hard work, honest songwriting, and clean production.
