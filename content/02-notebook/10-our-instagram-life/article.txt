Tweet. Post. Comment. This era has it's own lingo; a jargon-addled psuedolanguage that sometimes barely resembles recognized speech or written words. Children, teenagers, and adults alike all speak it, as everyone desperately tries to capture fleeting memories with short blocks of text, or a blurry photograph. Most attempts fail, falling short of the glorious moment when they were written or snapped.

Whenever I board the train, I'm surrounded by passengers craning their neck downward to catch up on the latest news. As if made from stone, they sit still while the city whizzes past, only rising immediately before exiting at their appointed stop. At concerts, when the focus should be on the performer, everyone raises their phone into the air, sometimes recording the entire performance, knowing fullwell the resulting video will only a pixelated mess.

This behavior is universally recognized, repeating itself daily without fail, seemingly controlled by a greater mind. We behave as the program instructs &mdash; peering through dark portholes into lives of our virtual friends, and ignoring our own. It's dangerous.

We complain that the world moves too fast, and how creative fulfilment is difficult to find &mdash; but the problem is us, not the world. As a society, we lied to ourselves, inventing shiny new ways to document our life, when in reality, they clutter our minds, and sometimes, prevent us from creating memories at all.

As your son throws his first softball pitch, would you rather watch, or fumble with your phone? When a performer walks on stage, pocket your phone and listen. Board the train, and stare out the window as the city rushes past. Be alive. If I'm busily tapping at my phone, I miss the magic of _life itself_.

Are Instagram, Facebook, and Twitter inherently bad for us? Of course not. I use all of them daily, but I'm always careful to close the laptop, or kill my phone when necessary. I'm alive for a fixed period of time. The magic of breathing, hearing, seeing, and feeling won't last forever.

It's imperative, more now than ever, that we develop healthy digital habits. Otherwise, the next generation will simply adopt our bad habits, and take them to the logical conclusion. An extreme interpretation is scary.
