It would be simple to label Joel Walter as yet another folk songwriter, riding the wave of the genre's increasing popularity. You would be wrong. Joel pens songs with emotional depth unmatched by only but a few of his peers.

Today on Inside the Machine, we begin by examining his most recent release, *Bitter Lake Reservoir*, the inspirations behind it, and his experiences on tour so far. Plus, you'll get to hear tracks from his past efforts, *Nowhere In Fiction*, and *Heart of Branches*.
