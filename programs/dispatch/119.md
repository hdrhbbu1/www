This week on Dispatch, Joshua and Nicholas are joined by Shane and Katrina, members of west-coast folk band, [The July](http://thejulymusic.com), and their producer, Dustin Jensen. Shane, Katrina, and Dustin stop by to discuss the band's new record (due out on November 11), "Everything Is Fine," and the many hurdles that can distract you from creating a record worth listening to.

As a friend who had used his talents before, Nicholas stepped in as mastering engineer, and had a chance to help shape the record according to his vision as well. In the end, through countless hours of work and frustration, everyone is proud of the final product: a debut record worthy of praise and careful listening.

Also on today's broadcast: more technical glitches than you can count! The gear in our studio was acting up during the show (like it has started doing often), and if we're to replace it (as we should) we need your help. Please visit our [donation page](http://machine.fm/donate) and give whatever you can. We (meaning Nicholas) would greatly appreciate it.
