Most creators, regardless of medium, adhere to an internal code of conduct. This list of basic rules governs their creative output, ensuring quality and artistic honesty. In my opinion, drafting these guidelines &mdash; or at least considering what you will or won't do for your art &mdash; is a required step before embarking on a creative career.

My friends know that I have a rather stringent set of rules. Even strangers, in casual conversation, have encountered them, and possibly you, dear reader, have as well through articles on this site. Until now, my exact standards have remained private; kept in my mind and recalled for myself only in times of need &mdash; but after much contemplation, I decided to share them here.

While the notes below won't apply to everyone, I believe they are easily generalized. I wrote them in first person, as recalled for myself, many times over. So, without any further discussion, I give you *The Craftsman's Creed*.

## Sleep On It

I understand creative work as the process of gathering disparate elements and arranging them to form a cohesive presentation. I will rarely, if ever at all, release work into the world without contemplating the results that it will have on myself, my career, a societal group, or the world at large.

## Use Your Medium Wisely

My creation will affect anyone who is exposed to it. More specifically, any viewer is exposed to my opinion, an inherent part of any artistic work. I will always carefully messages I communicate to the observer through my art, and do my best to never intentionally mislead anyone who comes into contact with it.
