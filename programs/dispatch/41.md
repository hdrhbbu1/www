  Joshua and Nicholas are no strangers to the world of home brewing. Together,
  they've crafted several tasty ales, and yet, to the world at large, beer
  making (and the process behind it) remains a mystery. Today, we pull the
  covers off with our guest Matt Gallagher, head brewmaster at Half Acre Beer.

Chicago's craft brewing scene has a rich and deep heritage. Over the last few years, we've seen many new breweries pop up: Two Brothers, Arcade, Begyle, and Dry Hop brewing have all grown up in the midwest's fertile soil. And yet, all of the wonderful beers made here began with Chicago's original craft brewery, [Half Acre](http://halfacrebeer.com).

Here at Dispatch, we're avid drinkers of Daisy Cutter, Gossamer, and Over Ale: the beers that, just over eight years ago, kickstarted Chicago's growing beer scene.

Today, Joshua and Nicholas are joined by Matt Gallagher, head brewmaster for this groundbreaking brewery. We chat about everything from the beginning until present day, while sipping on delicious cans of Pony Pilsner.
