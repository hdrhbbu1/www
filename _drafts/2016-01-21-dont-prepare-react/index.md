As we enter 2016, one of my major projects at [Until Now](http://untilnow.co) is a greenfield rewrite of an existing eCommerce platform. It's a massive undertaking with any toolset, but so far, I have been able to easily dispatch most bugs without a second thought. Even the tough problems, like deciding where to store application state, and how to change it, haven't shown themselves yet.
