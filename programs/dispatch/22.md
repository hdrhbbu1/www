A few weeks ago, we teased the Chicago design event, [Show of Hands](http://showofhandschicago.com) during our interview with curator [Emily Martin](http://nicholaswyoung.com/programs/dispatch/20). Today, Joshua, Susan, and Nicholas broadcast live from the show floor.

Together, they interview vendors and shoppers alike, reaching across several creative mediums and topics. T-Shirt makers, letterpress operators, and jewelry makers, are all featured here. For a full list of artisans mentioned in this program, see the list below.

We'll be back again with another round of talented creatives from Show of Hands next week.
