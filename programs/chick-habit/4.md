...would think I'm awesome! Today on Chick Habit, Adele Nicholas (of one-lady band [Axons](http://axonsband.com) and jumpsuit-wearing punk act [Puritan Pine](http://puritanpine.com)) and Red of [Red's Garden](http://redsgarden.bandcamp.com) (a multimedia project of art and music) discuss their artistic beginnings, and how their 16-year old selves would feel about them now. Hint: we think they would be pretty thrilled.

We play a couple of cuts from Axon's latest release, *Unmanagable*, their collaboration track "Two Coyotes", and hear a special live performance from Red of her song "Lost Girls".
