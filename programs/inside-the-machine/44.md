  It's loud and forceful. It's beautiful, too. The wall of sound created by The
  Paver's unique blend of cello, guitars, and drums is not your average listen.
  It recalls the moments of wild experimentation in early 90's post-rock but
  adds a shiny orchestral sheen. Dive in deep with Jesse, Billie, and Brendan
  today on Inside the Machine.

Turn it up. Today on the program, it's a solid hour of "baroque-core", courtesy of Chicago's [The Paver](http://thepaver.com). Just like their namesake - a loud, rattling, heavy machine - their music is forceful, and at times, angry. It's beautiful too. The wall of sound created by their unique blend of guitars, cello, and drums is anything but your normal.

Their latest release, *Trust*, recalls the moments of wild experimentation in early 90's post-rock, but adds a shiny orchestral sheen. It's freewheeling, screaming, and honest. Dive in deep with Jesse, Billie, and Brendan today on Inside the Machine.
