Being city dwellers, both of your hosts routinely use bicycles, as an alternate mode of transportation. Cars are bulky, expensive to maintain, and outright frustrating at times. Cities, like Chicago, are adding bicycle-only lanes, to make traveling safer for cyclists, where many walking and bike paths already criss-cross the metropolitan area.

There's no doubt: bicycles are a cultural touchstone for this young generation, as is the importance of where our products are made and designed. Today, Joshua and Nicholas are joined by Erin and Levi Borreson, the husband and wife team behind [Legacy Frameworks](http://legacyframeworks.com), a hand-built cycle outfit from Chicago.

Harkening back to when our city was the world's bicycle manufacturing capital, Legacy aims to capture the mystique of early two-wheeled design with their line of beautiful, simple commuter wheels.
