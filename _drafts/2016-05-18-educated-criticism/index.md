When speaking publicly, I'm working towards a handful of goals. Some are, of course, personal. My agenda is to inform and inspire the audience, among whom, hopefully, are several potential clients.

But the main goal &mdash; which may surprise you &mdash; is to weaken mental barriers. I want the audience to question their status quo; to investigate the many promising solutions to a given problem, and evaluate each on it's merits. If even one attendee questions the so-called *common wisdom*, I have succeeded.

*Common Wisdom* is difficult to erase. Often, it's also very wrong.
