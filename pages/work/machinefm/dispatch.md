From June 2013 through November 2015, I co-produced and co-hosted Dispatch, an
hour-long talk radio program that aired on [The Machine](/work/machine)
Broadcasting Network, with my friend and collaborator [Joshua
Wentz](http://joshuawentz.com). Billing itself as "a talk show at the intersection of art,
culture and commerce," Dispatch touches almost every area of the artists' life,
providing insight and courage to anyone with an itch to strike out on their own.

Sadly, the program's run was cut short [when The Machine
shuttered](/be-kind-rewind/) (you'll notice, we didn't record a final signoff),
but I am still incredibly proud of the 119 episodes that we did produce and
release.
